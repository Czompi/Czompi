# Hi there üëã

I'm David, a 26-year-old undergraduate Computer Science Engineering student at the [University of P√©cs, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology](https://english.mik.pte.hu/), with a dual focus on **software development** and **systems engineering**.

I specialize in cross-platform application development using C# and Java, and I manage self-hosted infrastructure and services with tools like Proxmox VE, Docker, and Linux-based networking. Whether it's designing modular software or deploying reliable infrastructure, I enjoy working across the full stack of both development and operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Systems Engineering

### üß∞ Virtualization & Infrastructure
- Running [Proxmox VE 8+](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve) (migrated from VMware ESXi in late 2023)  
- Containerized deployments using Docker  
- LXC/KVM virtualization with internal and public network segmentation  

### üåç Self-Hosted Infrastructure
I operate a multi-server environment consisting of:
- A **dedicated server in Germany** for all public-facing production services  
- A **home production server** for internal services and backups  
- Multiple **homelab/tinkering servers** for testing, learning, and experiments  

Main services include:
- Reverse proxy stack (Docker-based)  
- VPN and DNS servers  
- Monitoring stack using Grafana and Prometheus  
- Game server panel for personal use  
- Dockerized web applications based on CwATE-MA and CwATE-SB  
- Various custom utilities and containerized tools  

üîé You can find an overview of my setup here:

### üîê Security Measures
- Hardware & software firewalls  
- Container isolation, access control, and segmented networks  
- System-level monitoring and alerting for proactive defense
